### Small Assignment #4 (Still Continuing - Due 8AM, Mon, Day 9) - Midterm Groups 

**(1) Writing (on Google Docs)**
1. Mark your data source.
2. Explain why you are interested in this data.
3. What are some questions you want to answer in your project.
4. Who is your audience ?
5. Do you have any visual inspirations for your design? Share them, if any.

**(2) Design (On a sketchpad)**
1. Bring 2-3 versions of sketches that can be your main data visualization.
2. If you are planning to include multiple views in your work, plan them out as well. (But start with one)
- For example, you can have a flow such as one individual data point -> Small Multiples -> Time Series  
3. Think about placement of legends so we can read your visualization. 

**(3) Code**
1. If you need to self-aggregate your data source, finish that part. 
2. (If you are in p5) Using loadTable() in preload(), console out to see whether you can read your tabular data or not. Can you read a column of your choice? Can you read a particular row ? Can you access a particular column & row? [Day5](https://github.com/inhieh/anantu-dataviz-2022/tree/main/Day5) lab may be helpful for some of you.
