## DAY 2 

### P5.js
1. A friendly and well-supported environment to learn coding
2. Concepted around sketching and drawing 
3. Awesome Documentation on https://p5js.org/reference/ : Please do read reference here when you are using a certain function
4. [Maybe worth reading: p5 program flow](https://p5js.org/learn/program-flow.html)

### LAB 
1. [Open up the web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/): Sign up / Basic Environment 
2. Web Coordinate System (The Top Left corner is set to 0, 0)
3. [setup()](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/Ma4rAz2pt)
4. canvas - let's look at the chrome dev console 
5. [setup() vs draw()](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/X1yBoiNQO)
6. [Primitive shapes + Ways to define colors](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/oZxzrFBdt)
7. [Writing a custom function](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/IKpkfKgDT)
8. [conditionals and boolean](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/a4mTQrMUG)
9. [array.forEach() - Iteration](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/MoTuUP4mK)
10. [drawing with array, color(), lerpColor()](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/N7N9gwFCE)
11. [for loop - drawing mode: push pop and translate](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/B3a3izUGr)

### More on Color Basics 
1. [ColorMode](https://www.figma.com/file/S6djsp51ihfuN3J8glty3G): Let's check different ColorModes on Figma
2. [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en)
3. [RGB to Hex](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/rgb-to-hex.html) 

### SMALL ASSIGNMENT 2
#### Create an Abstract Drawing Made of Points, Lines and Planes about Contrasting Concepts

1. Concept Examples (Our Variables Set)
- Happy - Sad, Moving - Static, Equilibrium - Chaos, Low - High, Hot - Cold, Hungry - Full
2. Visual Insprirations: Kandinsky, Mondrian, Paul Klee, Bauhaus artists, Sol Lewitt Or Find your own Inspiration
3. Set up **your own logic** to visually express these concepts ex) Equilibrium, Chaos
- "Equilibrium" will be shown with lines that have same orientation and same size for the stroke thickness, 
- "Chaos" - Lines will have all different orientations and different thicknesses 
5. Start with a sketch on a paper 
6. Create a p5 sketch of your idea with Codes
7. When you are successful at visualizing one concept, create another one with different concepts going through the same process ex) Happy, Sad
8. Now, combine two sets of concepts and see if you can create a drawing that can show them together.
- (Happy, Sad) X (Equilibrium, Chaos) 
8. Your final drawing will have all your logics combined together
10. Jot down your questions that may have occured while you are working on it (either technical or creative) 

### Other Rules to Consider When Code
1. The canvas can be as big as you want. Let's make it > 600, 600 - createCanvas
2. Use a variety of 2d primitive shapes  - point, line, rect, ellipse, circle, arc....)
3. Set the right drawing mode for your shapes - ex: rectMode..
4. Experiment with colors - colorMode(), fill(), stroke(), color(), lerpColor()
5. If you are just making a static drawing, you only work in setup(), If you have an element that needs animation or color change, you can also utilize draw()
6. Use an array with loop (for loop/forEach) when you see fit
7. Be creative but you should be able to explain how to read your drawing to other people (No Legend Needed)
8. Share your web links with the class
