### SMALL ASSIGNMENT 2
#### Create an Abstract Drawing Made of Points, Lines and Planes. 
At this Point, do not worry about concept. Focus on making things happen on screen. 
Visual Insprirations: Kandinsky, Mondrian, Paul Klee, Bauhaus artists, Sol Lewitt Or Find your own Inspiration

### Some Rules to Consider When Code
1. The canvas can be as big as you want. Let's make it bigger than 600, 600 - createCanvas()
2. Use a variety of 2d primitive shapes  - point, line, rect, ellipse, circle, arc....
3. Set the right drawing mode for your shapes - ex: rectMode..
4. Experiment with colors - colorMode(), fill(), stroke(), color(), lerpColor()
5. If you are just making a static drawing, you only work in setup(), If you have an element that needs animation or color change, you can also utilize draw()
6. Use an array with loop (for loop/forEach) when you see fit
7. Be creative but you should be able to explain how to read your drawing to other people (No Legend Needed)
8. Share your web links with the class
