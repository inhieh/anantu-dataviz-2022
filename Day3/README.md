### In-Class Resource
1. [Whiteboard at Miroboard](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOOHyf34=/)

### Additional Learning Resources for Javascript in General
1. [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) - All chapters are available online for us to read. Really well written book about javascript concepts in general. 
2. [Mozilla Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements) - Explanation + Testground
3. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) - Explanation + Testground

### SMALL ASSIGNMENT 3 (Similar to #2 but with Variables)
#### Create an Abstract Drawing Made of Points, Lines and Planes about Contrasting Concepts
1. Concept Examples (Our Variables Set): They can have multiple values in between (ex: overjoyed - happy - neutral - sad - depressed)
- Happy - Sad, Moving - Static, Equilibrium - Chaos, Low - High, Hot - Cold, Hungry - Full, Rich - Poor
2. Visual Insprirations: Kandinsky, Mondrian, Paul Klee, Bauhaus artists, Sol Lewitt Or Find your own Inspiration
3. Set up **your own logic** to visually express these concepts ex) Equilibrium, Chaos
*  "Equilibrium" will be shown with lines that have same orientation and same size for the stroke thickness, 
* "Chaos" - Lines will have all different orientations and different thicknesses 
5. Start with a sketch on a paper in Class (3 Variations)
6. Create a p5 sketch of your idea with codes
7. When you are successful at visualizing one concept, create another one with different concepts ex) Happy, Sad
8. Now, combine two sets of concepts and see if you can create a drawing that can show multiple variable sets together.
- (Happy, Sad) X (Equilibrium, Chaos) => Happy Equilibrium, Sad Equilibrium, Happy Chaos, Sad Chaos
8. Your final drawing will have all your logics combined together
10. Jot down your questions that may have occured while you are working on it (either technical or creative) 

### Other Rules to Consider When Code
1. The canvas can be as big as you want. Let's make it > 600, 600 - createCanvas
2. Use a variety of 2d primitive shapes  - point, line, rect, ellipse, circle, arc....)
3. Set the right drawing mode for your shapes - ex: rectMode..
4. Experiment with colors - colorMode(), fill(), stroke(), color(), lerpColor()
5. If you are just making a static drawing, you only work in setup(), If you have an element that needs animation or color change, you can also utilize draw()
6. Use an array with loop (for loop/forEach) when you see fit
7. Be creative but you should be able to explain how to read your drawing to other people (No Legend Needed)
8. Share your web links with the class
