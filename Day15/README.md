### No Guest Speaker This Sunday

### Next Monday - the Final Presentation (Day 16 | Please log in by 8:55 AM)
1. All team members present. Please describe what each one worked on. 
2. Take it as an opportunity to do a **formal presentation**. **Make it engaging and relatable**. (We will have new audience/jury panels who don't know your work) 
- Project Background: Topic, Story, Audience (Target Users)
- Data: Data Source, Variables you chose, Data Cleaning/Filtering/Mining Process
- Design & Redesign Process 
- Take us to **Your Final Work** - How to Read/Interact 
- Plans for Future iterations / Problems that you couldn't solve 
3. In **Your Final Work** that is available online, please include

- Your names & roles
- A short description (story) about your work - Take it as a project where you are publishing your story found with data and visualization - Inspiration: [pudding](https://pudding.cool/)
- Main data visualization (Redesigned)
- Supportive materials to complete your project - Different views of your visualizations (Micro - Macro View), Important Findings, Playground 
- Data source / Any materials that need credit
- *This could be a separate page: Describe how you changed your design based on the insights found in user testing
6. Your work has to be **available online**. You can use either p5 web editor(fullscreen), a github [pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), or figma (if this is your case) 
7. *Even if you don't have a project with complete code, submit your coded portion as well (You don't have to present this in your presentation)
