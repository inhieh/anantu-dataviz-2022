### Understanding a CSV 
1. [What is csv](https://csvloader.com/csv-guide/what-is-csv) - a 2 min Reading
2. [What is a tabular data/csv](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=what+is+csv) - Coding Train! (just from 0:18 - 1:12)
  - For those of you who want to use data API, you can watch the entire video and learn the process  
  - It also talks about how to parse a tabular file, csv in general 

### Working with Arrays (For Tomorrow)
1. Minimum: [min()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/min) | Maximum: [max()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/max) Value in the array
2. [How to get a unique values from array](https://appdividend.com/2022/01/28/how-to-get-distinct-values-from-array-in-javascript/)
3. [Merging two arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat)
4. [Spread Syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

1. [Pivot Table Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bojnxjNMTM)

### Small Assignment #4 (DUE 1PM Day 6)
1. Go over how to work with a table object in p5.js. For example, how can you get the data from the third row & second column?
2. After you can access data points as you desired, think about how to represent this dataset graphically 
- What do you want to show? 
- What is the question you want to answer in this graphical representation? 
- (you can take either icecream.csv or iris csv for this exercise)
    1. For Example,
        1. I want to show which icecream is the cheapest
        2. I want to know which ice cream is cheap but has a good rating.
3. Start by drawing your plan on paper - Your design can include multiple segments such as following 
    1. All icecream prices view
    2. All icecream ratings view
    3. Comparing Icecream rating/price view
    4. (Or Some other aspect you discovered about your icecream data)
4. For Initial Exploration, try utilizing a pivot table and chart it out using "Chart" function in Google Spreadsheet. See how you may be able to improve the usual conventional chart representation in your own custom design

The following part can be done later
1. Translate your design into Code.
2. Try Adding a text value to indicate what we are looking at. 
3. Make things clear so we can understand 

**Midterm and Final can be done as a group. One group can have 3 people max. I'm expecting a full-fledged project from a group work. 
You also have a freedom to work alone.**
