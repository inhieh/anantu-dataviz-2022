### Today's Guest Speaker, [Professor Ram](https://www.prl.res.in/~ram/)'s Recommendation: 
1. Please go through the websites and the details of data are listed there.
2. For example, the PM2.5 data first let us concentrate on the sites in India - data is available in 6 cities from 2015.
3. In meteorological data, we can select temperature, relative humidity over Ahmedabad (data available starting from 1944) and start the analysis.
Regarding, Air quality data, apart from PM2.5 we have additional data sets on other short-lived climate pollutants.

### Small Assignment #4 (DUE 8AM, Day 7) - Continuation from yesterday
1. Finalize your team members (Maximum of three) 
2. Decide which data you want to work with
3. What questions are you trying to answer? (Relationships amongst variables, Related themes, Visualization method itself, Simply exploring?)
4. Explore Data (Google Spreadsheet - > Pivot Table -> Chart, [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) ) 
5. Who is your audience? 
6. Who provided your data? 
7. Come up with a visualization idea (Bring a couple of sketches for your main visualization. Explain your logic)
8. You can start small but be sure to able to scale it as you progress your project.

### Midterm Plans (We'll re-think the midterm presentation date) 
1. You can work with alone or with a team (Maximum of three. In case of a groupwork, You all have to contribute to the project. Specify your role in detail) 
2. You will make a custom designed visualization using your design and p5
- You start from your questions that you want to answer, or a goal you want to achieve. What is it that you investigate? What do you want to show?
- You Visualization becomes a tool to answer them 
- Think about relationship between your variables
3. Create a legend so we can read your Visualization (Don't start from an impression. Start with data. Use graphical forms. It doesn't have to be interactive)
4. Provide your "main visualization". Explain it with a legend
5. You can start wrting about your project and think about future ideas that can be added to explain your project
