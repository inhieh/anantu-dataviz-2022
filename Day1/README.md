### SMALL ASSIGNMENT #1 (Due: 1AM, Day 2)
**Create your own interpretation of Bertin's visual variables.** 

In this assignment, you will make **two designs**.

Each design will use position, size, shape, value, color, orientation and texture, to **represent numbers from 1, 5, 10 to 100**. 

1. **In your first design**, **represent quantity 1, 5, 10 and 100** in the **2 dimensional plane**.
- Please use graphical variables we are introduced to today. 
- [This one](https://www.figma.com/file/PKKJAx6Cy6YpSESg3IJyZT/Retinal-Variables-Exercise) was my attempt. 
Note that a legend is set up to give out some useful information about the logic. You may want to include it as well. 
- Use design environment of your choice, or pen & paper if you can create something legible.

2.  **In your second design**, utilize your understanding of visual variables in a **3 dimensional space** and **represent quantity 1, 5, 10 and 100**
- In other words, use physical objects or consider physical environment. 
- Think of Global population growth, [box by box](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_global_population_growth_box_by_box) talk by Hans Rosling or the [Berlin holocaust memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe) as your inspiration.  
- If creating something in real life is too difficult, you can create a digital/virtual mockup of some kind to demonstrate your idea. 
- If you really can't work in a physical dimension, you can make one more variation similar to (1). 
- But, please try first and see how far you can go.
