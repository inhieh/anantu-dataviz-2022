### Continuation of Small Assignment 5 (Due 8AM, Thur, Day 14)
#### Conducting User Testing & Synthesize your observations 
1. Four W's (Your user profile)
- Who is impacted by the issue? (Users' motivations and goals)
- What is the problem / What are the obstacles / What are they trying to do?
- Where will they be using this product (Is this digital or has a physical component)
- Why is this important ? / Why will users benefit from solving this problem?
2. Recruit Participants that fits your profile as close as possible 
3. Conduct the Interview 
- Introduction: Make them feel comfortable
- Disclaimer: We are testing the prototype, We are not testing you 
- Ask them their background related to your 4Ws
- Show them prototype and Get their impression  
Some Questions can be ...
What does the legend mean?
Can you read the maximum value of a certain variable? Which item has the highest value in a certain category? 
Can you find the number of icecream sales on a certain temperature?
How does it make them feel?
Does the color read okay? (Color test)
-> First part can be specific questions
-> after you are done with tasking them, you can go on to ask more general experience 
- Is this visualization useful? What will they change in terms of the data presentation or asthetics?
4. Synthesize your observations 
- Use notes taken during the user testing sessions to generate insights and to find common patterns (For example, Affinity Mapping). 
5. Plan your redesign 
- Based on the findings, the team decides directions to take action on. Think of the order of priority.
