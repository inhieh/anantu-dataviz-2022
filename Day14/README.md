## Day 14

#### User Testing Results - Synthesize Insights 

#### SVG with Javascript
1. [Vector on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/JSVhAfLHyF6UZqEN1CJ6Sf/Vector?node-id=0%3A1) - Save "ID attributes" when exporting
2. [Interaction of SVG with Vanilla Javascript](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/XL70jX-3z)
3. [SVG Animation with js](https://css-tricks.com/lodge/svg/27-animating-svg-javascript/)

#### P5 Sketch as SVG  
1. [P5.js - svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p5.js-svg) - This libary renders your p5 sketch as SVG 
2. [Their Examples](https://zenozeng.github.io/p5.js-svg/examples/#basic)
3. [Our Day 5 Example](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/j2wUJrBJj) - [Same Project with SVG Renderer and a Save function](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/xxPMlxfEg) 
4. [Load a Pre-created SVG with ID attributes](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/j4160Z0mdi) 
5. [Load SVG](https://editor.p5js.org/lee.inhye/sketches/eED6ILmy4) - Can't seem to really control individual attributes 

### How you may use SVG Renderer + Saved SVG 
You can create multiple views of your visualization and saved them as SVGs 
- You don't lose any quality of your images 
- You can include your SVGs in your project page (index.html), along with other supportive materials such as writings or findings of your project.

#### D3 - Drawing Data with SVG
If you want to work more extensively with SVG + Data, a better library to work with is [D3](https://d3js.org/). 
We'll take a look at it tomorrow, should you be interested.
P5: more friendly; more freedom to draw -> very custom visuals. Can work with sound/ml/other libraries. Canvas based (but we just learned how to use SVG renderer) 
D3: commonly used in data viz. You can use its pre-built chart types. SVG-based.  

#### Agenda For Tomorrow / Weekend
1. Now, we focus on redesigning, we'll see your final work next Monday (Day 16)
2. In your final work that is available online (either on p5 web editor shared, or github project), you have to include 
- Your Work title
- Your Main Data Visualization (Redesign)
- Other supportive materials to back your work
- Your data source
- Describe how your redesign process: design vs redesign based on your user testing (This could be a separate page)
3. Presentation your work (similar to your midterm presentation)
