# Data Viz 2022
Data Viz + User Testing Course for Anant U  (Feb 7 - March 7 2022)

(*This page will be updated as the course progresses)

## Day 1
### Small Assignment #1 (Due: Day 2)
**Create your own interpretation of Bertin's visual variables.** 

In this assignment, you will make two designs.

Each design will use **position**, **size**, **shape**, **value**, **color**, **orientation** and **texture**, to represent numbers from 1, 5, 10 to 100. 

(1) **In your first design**, work in the 2 dimensional plane. Please use graphical variables we are introduced to today, and 
**represent quantity 1, 5, 10 and 100**. [This one](https://www.figma.com/file/PKKJAx6Cy6YpSESg3IJyZT/Retinal-Variables-Exercise) was my attempt. 
Note that a legend is set up to give out some useful information about the logic. You may want to include it as well.

(2) **In your second design**, use your understanding in visual variables in a 3 dimensional space. 
In other words, use physical objects or consider your physical environment. 
(Think of Global population growth, box by box Hans Rosling as your inspiration or the monument project).  

If creating something in real life is too difficult, you can create a digital/virtual mockup of some kind to demonstrate your idea. 
If you really can't work in a physical dimension, you can make one more variation similar to (1). 
But, please try first and see how far you can go.
